You are building PromptStack — a community platform where vibe coders share, fork, and remix prompt workflows behind real projects.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Database: Supabase (Postgres)
- Auth: Supabase Auth (GitHub + Google OAuth)
- Image Storage: Supabase Storage
- Hosting: Vercel
- Validation: Zod

## Project Structure
/src
  /app          → Next.js App Router pages
  /components   → Reusable React components
  /lib          → Utilities, Supabase client, helpers
  /types        → TypeScript types and Zod schemas
  /hooks        → Custom React hooks

## Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript strict mode always
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed
- Use Supabase SSR helpers for auth
- Keep components small and focused
- Use Zod for all form validation and API input validation
- Use Tailwind for all styling — no CSS modules, no styled-components
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use arrow functions for components
- Error boundaries for all async operations

## Design System
- Dark theme (bg: #09090b, text: #e8e8ed)
- Font: JetBrains Mono for code/UI, system font for body
- Green accent: #3ddc84
- Border color: #1c1c25
- Minimal, developer-focused aesthetic
- No emojis in UI except where specifically needed

## Database
- All queries go through Supabase client
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Never expose service role key to client

## Important
- No console.log in production code — use proper error handling
- Always handle loading and error states
- Every page must have proper meta tags for SEO
- All forms must have proper validation with user-friendly error messages
